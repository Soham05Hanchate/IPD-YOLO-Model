📌 YOLO-Based Object Detection System

Innovative Product Development Project

This repository contains a custom-trained YOLO object detection model developed as part of the Innovative Product Development project. The project focuses on real-time object detection using a webcam, demonstrating the complete workflow from dataset creation to model deployment.

🔍 Project Overview

Designed and trained a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for real-time object detection

Built a custom dataset tailored to the project requirements

Implemented Python-based inference to run the trained model on a live webcam feed

🗂 Dataset Preparation

Images were manually annotated using Roboflow

Dataset includes approximately 700 images after augmentation

Applied augmentation techniques such as:

Rotation

Scaling

Flipping

Brightness and contrast adjustments

These steps improved model robustness and generalization to real-world scenarios.

🧠 Model Training

Trained using the YOLO architecture for efficient and high-speed detection

Optimized for real-time performance with acceptable accuracy

Final trained weights are included in this repository

🎥 Real-Time Inference

Python script provided to:

Load the trained YOLO model

Access the system webcam
